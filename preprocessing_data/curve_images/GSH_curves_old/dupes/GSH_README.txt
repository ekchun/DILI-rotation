GSH SC: mostly up direction

GSH: choose dupes

- curve fits generally in up direction
- all 4 expt points usually exhibit same trends
- 'stronger' toward 24 hr / high glucose, but IC50's similar across TPs
- down curves usually look erroneous and all expt points don't look similar
- highest conc's often cause a reversal of phenotype - probably cell death related?
- for some, 6h curves fit the down direction but 24 hr curves fit the up direction
- almost no curves look good in only down direction

GSH: model increase in GSH. 24H seems to be best if picking 1
