Model down direction
Keep curves w/ IC50's < 100uM (110 if there's activity in >1 condition)
More response at 24 hours and 24hr high glucose
Progressive response exhibited across conditions for many hits

For sc hits of only 1, and no follow up, mark no keep
For sc hits of 2/3/4, no follow up, mark yes keep

Only 1 MC hit: majority no
2/3/4: about 50/50 b/c many IC50's >100uM

All conc's above 3BMAD: y w/ relation (only mark ones that weren't already marked yes)
