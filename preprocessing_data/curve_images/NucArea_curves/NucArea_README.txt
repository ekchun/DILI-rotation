NucArea SC: mostly down direction

NucArea: choose direction of dupes
- don't favor up or down
- consider "altered" nucarea as a model instead of only one direction
- or both models
- consider neg ctrl dist when keeping a curve even if it's below 100uM IC50
- be more skeptical of singleton curve fit when no SC hit too
- some curves go up then down; rely on up part
- for sc hits w/ no follow up: 1/2/3/4 hit = no
- curve fits are more varied than GSH / messier
- sometimes glucose vs non glucost trends are seen - glucose could be protect or permissive
- some trends exhibited across >1 experimental condition but many singletons
- nucArea smaller maybe means compaction/apoptosis; larger means (senescense, proliferation,)
- all conc above baseline = y w/ relation
- mc hits incidental (no sc hit): 2 or more MC hits mostly y; 1 MC hit 50/50
