# DILI

## rotation fall 2025
Most of this is from Amanda's repo, but with additional messy code. New work includes:
- additional ROS and MMP training data
- creating a 'matrix' of cell health values for DILI compounds

### `data`
Only new datasets will be included in this repo. For individual models / cell health data, see Amanda's DILI repo

## `chemberta`
Code from Kien Nguyen (UDel) to use ChemBERTa to predict Cell Count classification.
